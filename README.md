# MyToy
It is an individual assignment for a unit called Rapid Web Development. This project is an ecommerce store prototype for my chosen product, which is a kind of toy called “blind box”. I implement HTML & Bootstrap, CSS, Python & Flask, and Flask-SQLAlchemy to complete the basic web application.
